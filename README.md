# The Game

NGB Casino (New Gentlemen Bears Casino) is a game of deception and action, artful combos and thoughtful manipulation. Each round, all players are dealt two cards, each a spell. Every betting round, a new common spell that all players may use is revealed on the table until there are three. After all players have bet, players fight using the spells they have been given and the winner takes the pot!

# Design

Spells are designed to be simple and elegant yet with vast potential for emergent gameplay through combination with other spells. Examples include deliberately blocking oneself in using the Wall/Pillar/Obelisk spells and then using the Switch spell to escape unharmed while trapping another player, or using the Voodoo Doll spell as a shield from projectiles instead of as a combo piece. These unintended, creative interactions are the heart and soul of NGB Casino, and lead to much of both the fun and skill of the game.
